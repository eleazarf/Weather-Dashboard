# Weather-Dashboard
A user-friendly web application that enables users to search for cities and access both the current weather and a 5-day forecast. Additionally, the application will automatically save the cities users have previously looked up in their local storage for quick access and reference.

# Module 6 Challenge

## Description:<br>
Developers can utilize third-party APIs to access external data and functionality by making specific requests to a designated URL. This challenge is about retrieving weather data for cities from the 5 Day Weather Forecast API provided by OpenWeatherMap. To accomplish this, I build a weather dashboard that dynamically updates HTML and CSS, running directly in the browser. To ensure smooth access, users can search for cities through the user-friendly web application and access both current weather and a 5-day forecast.<br>
